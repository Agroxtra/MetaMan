# MetaMan
iOS Application used to manage Metadata on all kinds of files (incl. photos)

This empty shell of an iOS Application is supposed to show up in the sharesheet for any kind of documents/files/photos/videos.
It will allow the user to control metadata saved for the selected file. 

The project is still in very early stages and will be treated like a side project.

## Features
- Remove Metadata from Files, Photos, Videos
- Edit Metadata of Files, Photos, Videos
- Add your own Metadata to Files, Photos, Videos
- Access the app over the share sheet embedded in iOS
- Save Files, Photos, Videos via the files app

## current Status
Prototyping phase started. I'm currently struggling to get the metadata for a image in the share sheet. 
The App currently contains a very basic share sheet extension with a basic table view where the metadata will be displayed later on. 

## Technologies used
- Swift 5
- Storyboards (in the future evtl. SwiftUI, currently to buggy)
